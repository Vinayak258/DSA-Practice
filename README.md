# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice**.  
I am solving problems topic-wise from the following curated sheets:

- **Striverâ€™s SDE Sheet**  
- **CodeBaba DSA Sheet**  

The purpose of this repository is to **track my daily progress, organize problems by topic, and improve problem-solving skills**.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

The repository is organized **topic-wise**, with each folder containing solutions for multiple problems:

DSA-Practice/
â”œâ”€â”€ arrays/ # Array-related problems
â”œâ”€â”€ binary_search/ # Binary Search & related questions
â”œâ”€â”€ linked_list/ # Linked List problems
â”œâ”€â”€ stack_queue/ # Stack & Queue problems
â”œâ”€â”€ recursion/ # Recursion problems
â”œâ”€â”€ tree/ # Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree
â”œâ”€â”€ graph/ # Graph-related problems
â”œâ”€â”€ dynamic_programming/ # DP problems
â””â”€â”€ README.md # This file


Inside each topic folder, files are named according to the problem for clarity, e.g.,
